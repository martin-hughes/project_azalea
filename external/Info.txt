googletest/googletest/LICENSE.txt for details.

GRUB:
-----

Parts of GRUB were previously distributed in binary form contained within the now deleted example disk image
extras/example_disc_image.vdi. This has been replaced by instructions for generating disk images manually, so it is no
longer necessary to distribute GRUB with this project.

GRUB was provided under the terms of the GPL version 3. No changes were made to the code, the source code for GRUB is
available on the GRUB website at https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/

The full GPLv3 licence can be read at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.
