# Project Azalea - Welcome

Project Azalea is an attempt to create a complete, but basic, OS kernel and enough tools that a user can interact with
it. It's not big or fancy, it was started as a plaything for the author but he thought it might be interesting or
useful for anyone else trying the same thing.

Project Azalea isn't the name of the finished product - it is merely a codename. Whether or not the project matures
enough to warrant a proper name remains to be seen.

## Code quality

Even a cursory glance at some parts of the code will show them not to be of excellent quality. Ideally it would all be
excellent, of course, but the author's enjoys experimenting and hacking to see what things he can find out - the
project is unlikely ever to be of production quality after all!

## More information

Further information about the project can be found in [Introduction.md](./docs/Introduction.md)

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome, but might respectfully be declined - being a hobby system there are some things Martin
would prefer to keep to himself. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for further details.

Even if you don't want to contribute but would be interested in a conversation about the project (or most other
things!) then please do get in touch.
