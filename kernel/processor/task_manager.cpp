/// @file
/// @brief The kernel's task manager.
///
/// In the OS, the basic unit of execution is a thread. Multiple threads are grouped in to a process. A process defines
/// the address space and permissions of all threads that are associated with it.
///
/// The task manager is responsible for managing the creation and destruction of threads, as well as for scheduling
/// them onto the processor. This is done in a very crude, round robin kind of way.
///
/// The threads (as a task_thread object) point at each other via task_thread::next_thread, in a cycle. The processors
/// move around the cycle until they find a thread that is permitted to run (i.e. not suspended) and not locked (by
/// task_thread::cycle_lock). Being locked means that another processor is about to execute it.
///
/// Notice that much of the code in this file is contained within functions, rather than being delegated to the classes
/// of the relevant objects. This is simply because of how this code comes from very early on in the project - it may
/// well change one day.

// Known defects:
// - There's a possible race condition where waiting for a thread just as it is about to be destroyed may cause the
//   waiting thread to have to wait until the object is destroyed until it gets signalled, rather than being
//   signalled at the initial destruction.
// - It is possible to create a thread just as the process is being destroyed.
