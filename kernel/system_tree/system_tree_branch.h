///
/// System Tree is capable of storing any object that implements this interface, calling it a "branch". It is up to the
/// derived class how to implement this in a way that suits it best - for example, the implementation of an on-disk
/// filesystem would not necessarily match that of a virtual "proc"-like tree.
///
/// Some functionality that would be useful for all System Tree branches is included here.
///
/// It is not necessary for deriving classes to re-document the members of this interface unless there is anything
/// interesting to say.
