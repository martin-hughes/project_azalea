/// @brief General functions for dealing with processes in Project Azalea

/// These functions are intended for things like:
/// - Loading the processes
/// - Interacting with their memory space
/// - The high level interface for starting, stopping or otherwise communicating with them.
///
/// Lower level functionality remains with the code in /processor.
///
/// This distinction isn't particularly clear at the moment, and the aim for the future is to make this code part of
/// System Tree (hence its location)
